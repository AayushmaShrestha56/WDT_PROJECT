            <p>Do you know what’s the foundation of any therapy system? Confidentiality. Confidentiality is an important foundation of any therapy system; it builds a client-therapist relationship. In order to have honest conversations with the therapists, it’s important to make the client feel a sense of comfort.
<br><br>


It really doesn’t matter if the clients are opting for traditional therapy or online therapy, their privacy must be prioritized by all therapy systems. Confidentiality lays the basis of trust and healing. This also makes the whole therapy process effective as well.
<br>
<br>

In this blog, we will be taking a deep look at what are confidentiality terms in therapy and what happens when a therapist breaks confidentiality. Let’s get started!
            </p>
        
  
<h2>What is Confidentiality in Therapy?
</h2>
              <p>Confidentiality in therapy makes a client feel supported and comforted around the therapist. It also helps in building trust, and a therapeutic and honest relationship with the therapist. Therapists are highly trained and monitored to protect client’s privacy. Many countries across the globe have their own laws and regulations regarding the confidentiality of clients.
               <br>
                <br>
                <b>
                For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is available in Europe, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is available in the USA. A client has to sign a written permission before starting the discussion with the therapist. This ensures client confidentiality and safety. Under the signature, the company or therapy system cannot use the client’s details or information inside or outside the office.
                </b><br>
                <br>
                In terms of confidentiality, the therapists are highly trained and are kept mindful of maintaining confidentiality even when they write official session notes for the clients. If the client encounters the therapist in real life, many therapists prepare their clients for the possibilities in the earlier sessions only.

             <h2>What Happens When a Therapist Breaks Confidentiality of a Client?</h2>
            
            <p> According to laws and regulations, there are specific and clear consequences for breaching a client’s confidentiality. There are certain instances where therapists are asked to report personal information about the clients such as:
                <br>
                <br>
               
                When the client poses a danger to others or is involved in self-harm
                <br>
                <br> When the therapist suspects abuse, violence, or threatening
                <br>
                <br>  When the client is legally forced by a court order
                <br>
                <br> Most therapy systems include detailed explanations of laws and regulations related to the confidentiality of the client. You can read the company’s laws and regulations under the privacy policy section. Every client is asked to sign the privacy policy before entering the first session. Important headlines are always provided to the client verbally in early sessions as well. It usually protects the client from confidentiality issues before engaging in therapy.
                
                Therapists are highly trained to not break or breach the confidentiality of any client. In order to manage confidentiality, every therapist employs a supervisor. Supervisors in therapy generally supervise a therapist’s work, make sure they’re on track and do not breach the confidentiality of clients.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the therapist breaches the client’s confidentiality apart from abuse, violence, self-harm, or court orders, the client can take disciplinary actions or legal actions against the therapist. In such cases, termination, lawsuits, criminal charges, and other cases can be attained.
