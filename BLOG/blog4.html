                .</h3>
<p><b>Hypersomnia does share some similarities with other sleep disorders such as; </b>    </p>
<br>

    <b>1. Sleep-Wake Disorders</b> <br>
    <br>Sleep-wake disorders are wherein you struggle with the quality of sleep, time, and amount of sleep. These disorders can cause daytime sleepiness and can even cause impaired cognitive or executive functioning. Sleep-wake disorders are also chronic disorders and can have symptoms such as;
    <br>
    <br>

    Excessive daytime sleepiness
    <br>
    Memory issues
    <br>
    Trouble concentrating
    <br>
    Depression
    <br>
    Insomnia
    
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    


     <b>2. Obstructive Sleep Apnea
        <br>
     <br>



     </b>This is another chronic sleep disorder that causes restrictive breathing or suspended breathing during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea can result in fretful sleep and can cause you to feel drowsy and sleepy in the daytime.                  <br>
     <br> <br>

   
   
    <b>3. Narcolepsy</b> <br>
    <br> Hypersomnia is also connected to narcolepsy, a sleep disorder where the brain cannot control your sleep-wake cycle. The symptoms that hypersomnia shares with narcolepsy as a disability can include;
    <br>
    <br>


    Daytime sleepiness
    <br>Hallucinations
    <br>Sleep paralysis
    <br>Nighttime wakefulness
    <br>Cataplexy (loss of muscle control)
    <br><br>
    
    <h3>Can Hypersomnia be Treated?</h3>
    <p>Yes, there are treatment options to help you cope with hypersomnia. The first step is to diagnose the potential cause of the sleep disorder and then discuss the appropriate approach with a professional. Treatment approaches can include behavioral counseling related to sleep issues and treatment strategies focused on improving sleep hygiene.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hypersomnia treatment focuses primarily on addressing the underlying causes, especially when hypersomnia is caused by a mental health disorder or a medical condition.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other ways you can cope with hypersomnia can include maintaining a good sleep schedule. You can work on establishing a regular sleep schedule, having a proper sleep environment, and limiting beverages such as caffeine and alcohol before bed.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can also try to limit your screen time before bed. Blue light from digital screens can mess with the melatonin production in your body. So avoid using your smartphones or watching TV before bed.</p>
                     <br>
                   
            </p>
        <h3>What Next?</h3>

            <br>
            <br>
