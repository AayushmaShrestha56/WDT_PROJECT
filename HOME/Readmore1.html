        <h1>Mental Health - “Mental health is not a destination, but a process. It's about how you drive, not where you're going.”</h1>

             <br>
             <p>Mental health is our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It is how we think, feel, and act. It helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. 
                Just like our physical health, it is important to all people at any age group.</p>

            <p> Mental health is a crucial component of overall well-being, impacting how individuals think, feel, and interact with others. 
                It encompasses emotional, psychological, and social aspects, influencing daily functioning and quality of life.
                Common mental health disorders include anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder, each presenting unique challenges.</p>
            <p> Early intervention and effective treatment, such as therapy and medication, can significantly improve outcomes.
                Promoting awareness and understanding is vital to reducing stigma surrounding mental health issues. 
                Additionally, self-care practices, including regular exercise and mindfulness, play a key role in maintaining mental
                 health. Prioritizing mental well-being is essential for a fulfilling life.</p>
            <h2>Why is mental health important for overall health? </h2>

              <p>  Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.
                 Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk factors and exacerbate the symptoms of mental illnesses like Depression or Bipolar Disorder.</p>
   
                 <div class="box">
                <h3>Common triggers of mental health issues can include:</h3>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Stressful Life Events:</strong> Major changes such as <span class="highlight"> divorce, job loss, or the death of a loved one</span>can trigger mental health challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Trauma:</strong>  Experiencing or witnessing traumatic events can lead to conditions like PTSD.</li>
        <li><strong>Isolation:</strong>  Loneliness and lack of social support can contribute to depression and anxiety.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Issues:</strong>  Chronic illnesses or significant health changes can impact mental well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Workplace Stress:</strong>   High-pressure jobs or toxic work environments can trigger mental health issues.</li>
